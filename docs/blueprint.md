## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep forest green (#114323), modified from user request, to represent growth, sustainability, and the eco-focus of the platform. Its subtle difference from the original serves to avoid overused hues in the environmental space.
- Background color: A very dark desaturated green (#030A05) for a premium, sophisticated feel that enhances contrast with the primary color and gold accents.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC34A), modified from the user-specified gold tone to add vibrancy and signal important interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, used for clear, accessible information presentation.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for elegant headings.
- Use gold iconography representing crops, animals, and income streams to enhance visual communication and align with the premium theme.
- Implement soft glowing hover states for buttons to provide feedback and enhance interactivity.
